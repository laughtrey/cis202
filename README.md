# CIS 202 - Introduction to Programming 2 - Big C++ by Cay Horstmann

## Final Grade: A

## Projects

### 5 Review of Classes - Feb 11
>Just review of Chapter 5 with classes and how they operate. Creating a student class and some functions.
>This was a fun refresher! I'm also going to start here to strive to comment and document better.

### 7 Review of Pointers - Feb 25
>Another review, this time with pointers. It is refreshing to feel like I know what I am doing. I want to
>go back and work on my old initial pointer project for fun since I know more than I did before as well.

### 8 Inheritance and Polymorphism - March 1
>This is a lot of fun. Deriving classes from base classes is like DLC for C++.
>This was easy for me to grasp, but I'm still working out what a derived class can access, and I'm going to think hard when an object deserves it's own base class vs a derived one.

### 14 Operator Overloading - March 11
>Working on the default operators. Extracting a series of numbers and putting them in a vector is easy enough, the algorithm to multiply and then add to the next number
>in a result-vector will be a challenge.

### 16 Templates - March 18
>Templates are really interesting, making functions or templatized classes that can work with any data type seem obvious to me now.

### 12 Lists, Queues, and Stacks - March 25
>I'm going to explore linked lists a bit more. I really like using the vector as a data container, it has a lot of useful built
>in functions and it clicks with me, but after using arrays a bit more in Java I can see the benefit of other types and working with them.

### -- Midterm - April 4
>This was a simple-ish project. A lot easier than BigInteger for sure. It simulates an address book. I used vectors
>instead of lists, since I'm still figuring those out.

### 13 Sets - April 15
>The Sieve of Eratosthenes was fun to do. Implementing mathematical algorithms that people who have been
>dead for thousands of years is what Computer Science is all about.

### 17 Stacks - April 29
>Exception handling with stacks. A good set of habits to have, if I had to guess.

### 11 Sorting and Searching - May 6
>Sorting data containers and binary searching, a telephone lookup program with multiple ways to sort and search.
>This may be one of the more intricate projects.

### Qt Programming - May 20
>Started the first Qt project today, which is a lot of fun. Just basic working with the window and design framework.
>It's nice to finally be able to see code hooked up to a window instead of a command line.

### Final Project - June 3
>The Final was a lot like the midterm, in fact all I really did was add more data fields. It was a little too easy,
>I'm going to hook this up to Qt over the summer. I need to learn a framework already.
