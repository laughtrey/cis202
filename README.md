# CIS 202 - Introduction to Programming 2 - Big C++ by Cay Horstmann

## Projects

### 5 Review of Classes - Feb 11
>Just review of Chapter 5 with classes and how they operate. Creating a student class and some functions.
>This was a fun refresher! I'm also going to start here to strive to comment and document better.
### 7 Review of Pointers - Feb 25
>Another review, this time with pointers. It is refreshing to feel like I know what I am doing. I want to
>go back and work on my old initial pointer project for fun since I know more than I did before as well.
### 8 Inheritance and Polymorphism - March 1
>This is a lot of fun. Deriving classes from base classes is like DLC for C++.
>This was easy for me to grasp, but I'm still working out what a derived class can access, and I'm going to think hard when an object deserves it's own base class vs a derived one.
