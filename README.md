# CIS 202 - Introduction to Programming 2 - Big C++ by Cay Horstmann

## Projects

### 5 Review of Classes - Feb 11
>Just review of Chapter 5 with classes and how they operate. Creating a student class and some functions.
>This was a fun refresher! I'm also going to start here to strive to comment and document better.
### 7 Review of Pointers - Feb 25
>Another review, this time with pointers. It is refreshing to feel like I know what I am doing. I want to
>go back and work on my old initial pointer project for fun since I know more than I did before as well.
### 8 Inheritance and Polymorphism - March 1
>This is a lot of fun. Deriving classes from base classes is like DLC for C++.
>This was easy for me to grasp, but I'm still working out what a derived class can access, and I'm going to think hard when an object deserves it's own base class vs a derived one.
### 14 Operator Overloading - March 11
>Working on the default operators. Extracting a series of numbers and putting them in a vector is easy enough, the algorithm to multiply and then add to the next number
>in a result-vector will be a challenge.
### 16 Templates - March 18
>Templates are really interesting, making functions or templatized classes that can work with any data type seem obvious to me now.
### 12 Lists, Queues, and Stacks - March 25
>I'm going to explore linked lists a bit more. I really like using the vector as a data container, it has a lot of useful built
>in functions and it clicks with me, but after using arrays a bit more in Java I can see the benefit of other types and working with them.
