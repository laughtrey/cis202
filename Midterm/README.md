# Midterm Project
* Write an address book program that will accomplish the following:
    * Read name and address data from the user either from the keyboard or from a file.
    * While reading the names and addresses, put the names into an appropriate data structure.
    * After reading names and addresses, allow user to search for names and change the names or addresses in the container data structure.
    * Allow user to write out the container data structure to a comma delimited file, this file is different from the input file.

The input file will have the following form, 1 line for the name the next line for the address:

```
name
address
name
address
etc
```
Use features of c++ that you have learned so far, such as classes, and dynamic data structures. Your program will also be evaluated regarding readability and structure (functions, and methods).

Due: April 4, 2019.
