# Exercise P17.1.
* One argument used to justify the fact that the `stack` data structure in the standard library does not throw exceptions is that it is easy to add these facilities. Create a class `SafeStack` that implements a stack of strings. Use an instance of `stack<string>` to hold the underlying values, and implement the same interface as that data type. However, your class should throw an exception if an attempt is made to remove a value from an empty stack.
