### Pointer Programming Project
# Implement a class Person with two fields name and age, and a class Car with three fields

* the model
* a pointer to the owner (a Person*)
* a pointer to the driver (also a Person*)
>Write a program that prompts the user to specify people and cars.  Store them in a  vector<Person*> and a
>vector<Car*> .  Traverse the vector of Person objects and increment their ages by one year.  Finally, traverse the 
>vector of cars and print out the car model, owner's name and age, and the driver's name and age.
