### Exercise P5.9
>Implement a class Student. For the purpose of this exercise, a student has a name and a total quiz score.
>Supply an appropriate constructor and functions
>get_name(), add_quiz(int score), get_total_score(), and get_average_score().
>To compute the latter, you also need to store the number of quizzes that the student took.

### Exercise P5.10
>Modify the Student class of Exercise P5.9 to compute grade point
>averages. Member functions are needed to add a grade, and get the current GPA.
>Specify grades as elements of a class Grade. Supply a constructor that constructs a
>grade from a string, such as "B+". You will also need a function that translates grades
>into their numeric values (for example, "B+" becomes 3.3).
